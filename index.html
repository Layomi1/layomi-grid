      <p class="Dan" >I received a job offer mid- <br> course, and the subjects I <br> learned were current, if not more <br> so,
      in the company I joined. I <br> honestly feel I got every penny’s <br> worth.</p>
      <p class="one">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I’ve been looking to make a transition <br> and have heard some people who had an <br> amazing experience here. I signed up
      for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I  <br>  enrolled shortly thereafter.
      The next 12 weeks <br> was the best - and most grueling - time of my <br> life. Since completing
      the course, I’ve <br> successfully switched careers, working as a <br>
      Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

      <p class="four">“ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The <br> program
      gave me the confidence necessary to be <br> able to go out in the world and present myself as a <br> capable
      junior developer. The standard is above the <br> rest. You will get the personal attention you need <br> from

      <p class="Kira">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p>
      <p class="five"> “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a <br> line of code. I needed some structure from <br>
      professionals who can help me learn programming <br> step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a <br> former
      student of theirs who can only say <br> wonderful things about the program. The entire <br> curriculum and staff
      did not disappoint. They were <br> very hands-on and I never had to wait long for <br> assistance. The agile team
      project, in particular, <br> was outstanding. It took my learning to the next <br> level in a way that no tutorial
      could ever have. In <br> fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an <br> example of my developent
      experience. It ce<rtainly <br> helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after <br> receiving multiple offers.
      100% recommend! ” </p>
